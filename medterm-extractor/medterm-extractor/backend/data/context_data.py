"""
Context-awareness reference data for the ENHANCED Aho-Corasick pipeline only.

Per the thesis (Chapter 3, "Context-Aware Validation"), some dictionary terms
are lexically ambiguous: the same string can be a clinical symptom/drug term
in one context and an ordinary, non-clinical word in another
(e.g. "cold" as an illness vs. "cold compress").

AMBIGUOUS_TERMS   - terms that require a surrounding-token check before being
                     accepted as a valid clinical match.
NEGATIVE_CONTEXT  - tokens that, if found in the ±k window around a hit,
                     suggest the term is NOT being used clinically -> reject.
POSITIVE_CONTEXT  - tokens that, if found in the ±k window, confirm clinical
                     usage -> accept.
CONTEXT_WINDOW_K  - how many tokens to the left/right of a hit are inspected.

None of this is used by the original/baseline algorithm, which performs
exact matching only, exactly as specified in the paper's "Existing Algorithm".
