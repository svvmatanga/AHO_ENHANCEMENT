"""
Transformer-based Optical Character Recognition (TrOCR) engine.

Per the thesis (3.4.2, "Context-Aware Validation"):
    "TrOCR, implemented via the Hugging Face Transformers library with
    PyTorch as the underlying deep learning engine, converts prescription
    images into raw text strings. OpenCV (cv2) and Pillow (PIL) are used
    for image preprocessing prior to TrOCR: OpenCV converts the image to
    grayscale, applies adaptive thresholding, dilation, and contour
    detection to isolate handwritten regions, while Pillow handles image
    loading and format normalization."

This module is shared by BOTH the original and enhanced pipelines --
OCR is the input layer that happens before either algorithm runs; it is
not itself part of the Aho-Corasick enhancement being studied.

NOTE: the first call downloads TrOCR's handwritten-text model weights
(microsoft/trocr-large-handwritten) from Hugging Face, which requires
an internet connection. The model is cached locally afterwards.

    Splits a prescription image into individual text-line images using a
    horizontal ink-projection profile, rather than OCRing the whole
    multi-line image in one shot (TrOCR's handwritten model is trained to
    read a single line at a time; feeding it several lines at once
    produces garbled/near-empty output).

    Steps:
      1. Grayscale + light blur + adaptive threshold to isolate ink from
         a textured/creased paper background.
      2. Sum ink pixels per row -> a 1-D profile of "how much handwriting
         is on this row". Rows above a small threshold are "active".
      3. Group consecutive active rows into bands, merging bands that are
         only a few pixels apart (so a single line with an ascender/
         descender gap doesn't get split in two).
      4. Crop each band using the FULL image width (so a fragment like
         "#14" positioned far to the right of a line isn't cut off), pad
         it slightly, and upscale short strips so TrOCR gets a usable
         input height.
